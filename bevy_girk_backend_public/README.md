This crate contains types shared between the server backend and your implementation code. This crate exists to reduce the dependency surface of the backend and facilitate WASM clients since the backend is native-only.

The backend encompasses:
- `bevy_girk_game_hub_server`
- `bevy_girk_host_server`
